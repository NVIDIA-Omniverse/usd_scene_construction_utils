# Example - Hello Box

This example demonstrates creating a simply box shape and adding a dome light
to a scene.

It doesn't include any assets, so should load very quickly.  This is simply 
so you can get quick results and make sure usd_scene_construction_utils is working.  Once you're
set up and working, you'll want to use omniverse with a nucleus server so you
can pull from a rich set of assets, like in the [hand truck example](../hand_truck_w_boxes/).

## Instructions

1. Modify the path on line 3 of ``main.py`` to the path you cloned usd_scene_construction_utils
2. Launch [Omniverse Code](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse/code-app)
3. Open the script editor
4. Copy the code from ``main.py`` into the script editor
5. Run the script editor.
